## Reporting Security Issues

If you are a security researcher and believe you have found a security vulnerability, I would like to work with you to investigate it.
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, report them to security@skuflic.com.

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure I have received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help me better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages
I prefer all communications to be in English or Croatian.

## Thank you
Thank you for making the Internet, my products and/or services safer.
